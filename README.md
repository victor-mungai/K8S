üßë‚Äçüíª Kubernetes Learning Repo  

This repository documents my **hands-on Kubernetes learning journey**.  
It contains YAML manifests, automation scripts, and small projects I built while exploring **Kubernetes and DevOps practices**.  
The repo is meant to serve both as a **learning log** and a **reference portfolio** for deploying and managing applications in containerized environments.
